# glass_login
Glassmorphic Effect: In the CSS, the backdrop-filter: blur(10px) creates the blurred, frosted-glass effect. The combination of a semi-transparent background (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)) and border styles gives it a realistic glass appearance.
Form Design: The login form uses modern UI/UX design principles with floating labels (the labels move up when the user types in the field).
JavaScript: Basic form validation is included using JavaScript to alert the user upon a successful login (this can be replaced with actual login logic).
